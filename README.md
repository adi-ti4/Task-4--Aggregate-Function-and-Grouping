# Task-4--Aggregate-Function-and-Grouping
Aggregate functions are special functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single summarized result. They are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause to summarize data for specific groups, but can also be used without grouping to produce an overall summary. 

Aggregate functions ignore NULL values (except COUNT(*), which counts all rows). The most common aggregate functions include:

COUNT() – Returns the number of rows or non-NULL values.

SUM() – Calculates the total sum of numeric values.

AVG() – Returns the average (mean) value.

MIN() – Finds the smallest value in the set.

MAX() – Finds the largest value in the set.
